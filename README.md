In this project, I have worked with DOM manipulation and timers in JavaScript. Reviewing setTimeout and setInterval timers was really cool with this project. I've enjoyed to convert rgb() color format to hex code 🎨 and it was great to try some new DOM methods like copy the selected string to the clipboard 📋. I like building projects with vanilla-js and it keeps me up!💥

- Features of the colorOFTheTime:
  > Colors are generated in 1 second and users can copy the hex code by clicking text box.
  > Also, we can see the time on the page thanks to the Date object in JavaScript.
